# Corresponding source for generated local-shell binaries

Conduit release builds generate Android/aarch64 binaries in
`android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/` for the optional on-device local Arch
Linux shell. This directory records the corresponding-source information for
those generated binaries.

Conduit redistributes these binaries; it does not claim authorship of them. They
are built from the pinned Termux `termux-packages` recipes.

The bundled files and versions are listed in
[`../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). GPL/LGPL license
texts and component-specific notices are in [`../licenses`](../licenses) and
[`../notices`](../notices).

The expected generated binaries are identified by
[`bundled-binaries.sha256`](bundled-binaries.sha256). The binaries themselves
are not checked in; release and reproducible-build pipelines regenerate them.

The GPL/LGPL upstream source archives named by the pinned Termux recipes are
included in [`upstream-sources`](upstream-sources) and identified by
[`upstream-sources.sha256`](upstream-sources.sha256).

Reference Termux `.deb` packages for the same package versions are identified in
[`termux-package-checksums.md`](termux-package-checksums.md). The relevant
Termux package recipes and patches are snapshotted in
[`termux-recipes`](termux-recipes), pinned to upstream commit:

`ac296452b8ebec390cad3bce9060577c96099b10`

Original upstream repository:

## GPL / LGPL corresponding source

For GPL and LGPL components, the corresponding source is the local upstream
source archive plus the Termux package build recipe and patches for the exact
package version shipped by Conduit.

For public release builds, do not change any generated `.so` without updating
`bundled-binaries.sha256`, `upstream-sources/*`, `upstream-sources.sha256`,
`termux-package-checksums.md`, `termux-recipes/packages/*`, this table, and
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` in the same change.

## Conduit-side binary changes

Android only extracts native libraries named like `lib*.so` from `jniLibs`, so
Conduit renames executable files into that shape. Three dynamic-linker names were
also rewritten in place so the renamed files resolve from `nativeLibraryDir`:

- `libtalloc.so.2` -> `libtalloc.so`
- `libbusybox.so.1.38.0` -> `libbusybox.so`
- `liblzma.so.5` -> `liblzma.so`

The rewrite is a byte-preserving string replacement with trailing NUL padding;
the replacement strings are shorter than the originals. No source code changes
are made by Conduit.

The exact, reproducible transformation is the script
[`rewrite-soname.sh`](rewrite-soname.sh) in this directory. It is run by
[`../../tools/build-local-shell-binaries.sh`](../../tools/build-local-shell-binaries.sh)
after rebuilding the pinned Termux packages. If intentionally changing the
generated payload, refresh `bundled-binaries.sha256`:

```bash
third_party/source-offer/rewrite-soname.sh
sha256sum android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/*.so \
  > third_party/source-offer/bundled-binaries.sha256
```

Verify the shipped binaries with either:

```bash
third_party/source-offer/rewrite-soname.sh --verify
# or, manually:
for f in android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/*.so; do
  echo "== $f =="
  readelf -d "$f" | grep -E 'NEEDED|SONAME'
done
```

## Rebuilding for releases

Release and reproducible-build pipelines regenerate the native payload before
building APKs:

```bash
tools/build-local-shell-binaries.sh
```

The script uses the pinned `termux-packages` commit above for the full Termux
build system, builds the Android aarch64 package set, copies and renames the
needed outputs into `android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/`, runs
`rewrite-soname.sh`, and checks `bundled-binaries.sha256`. F-Droid provides the
Termux checkout with `TERMUX_PACKAGES_DIR`; otherwise the script clones it.

The `third_party/source-offer/termux-recipes` snapshot is kept for compliance
and review. It is not a complete replacement for Termux's build system; the
full pinned `termux-packages` checkout supplies `build-package.sh`, toolchain
setup, dependency handling, and package massage logic.

## Root filesystem

The Arch Linux ARM root filesystem is not bundled in the APK. It is downloaded
on first use from the pinned URL and SHA-256 in
`lib/features/local_shell/local_shell_config.dart`. It is distributed via
Termux's `proot-distro` release assets and maintained by Arch Linux ARM.
